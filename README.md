# Mapping_Earthquakes

This project displays an interactive map showing earthquake data using JavaScript and Leaflet.js. The map includes two main layers:

Earthquakes Layer: Displays recent earthquakes with markers representing magnitude.

Tectonic Plates Layer: Shows boundaries of tectonic plates.
These boundaries help us understand the geology and movement of the Earth's crust. 

Technologies Used: JavaScript, Leaflet.js, GeoJSON, HTML, CSS.
